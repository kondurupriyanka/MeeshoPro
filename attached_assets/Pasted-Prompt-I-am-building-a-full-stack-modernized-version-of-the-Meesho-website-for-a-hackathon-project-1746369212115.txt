Prompt:

I am building a full-stack modernized version of the Meesho website for a hackathon project. Please create a full-length ecommerce website similar in structure to Meesho with a sleek, minimalist, and modern UI using React + TailwindCSS (frontend) and optionally Node.js/Express or Firebase for backend.

‚úÖ Website Requirements:
Modern UI

Use TailwindCSS for a clean, responsive design.

Include a sticky header, side filters, smooth hover effects, and modern cards.

Sample Products

Add at least 10 sample fashion products (e.g. sarees, kurtis, t-shirts, accessories).

Each product should include:

Name, image, price, rating, delivery time, return policy, seller info.

Core Features to Add (Enhance Original Meesho Experience):

1. Product Comparison Tool

Allow users to select multiple products and view them side-by-side.

Comparison should include price, rating, seller info, delivery days.

2. Price History Graph

Show a chart (use Recharts or Chart.js) of a product‚Äôs price over time (past 30 days).

Use mock historical price data.

3. Price Drop Notification

Let users ‚Äúwatch‚Äù a product and simulate price drop alerts.

Use dummy logic to mimic notifications via UI.

4. AI-Powered Recommendations

On product view, show ‚ÄúYou may also like‚Äù section based on category.

Simulate recommendation logic using tags or categories.

5. Try-On Preview (Fashion Only)

For sarees/kurtis, show a basic try-on preview with static model overlay.

Use placeholder images to simulate the feature.

6. Personalized Feed

Home page should reorder products based on user interaction history (e.g., favorited categories).

Can be simulated with basic state or local storage.

7. Wishlist Prioritization

Wishlist page should allow sorting by price drops, popularity, and availability.

8. AI Chatbot

Add a floating AI chatbot button (bottom right corner).

The chatbot should respond to FAQs like:

‚ÄúWhere is my order?‚Äù

‚ÄúSuggest me kurtis under ‚Çπ500‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is the return policy?‚Äù

It can be rule-based or use mock AI logic.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies:
Frontend: React + TailwindCSS

Backend (optional): Firebase or Express.js

Use local state or mock JSON files for data if backend is not implemented.

üéØ Goal:
This is for a hackathon. The website should feel like a real working ecommerce platform inspired by Meesho but with added smart features and cleaner design. Prioritize functionality and user experience.
